I learn best by building things, breaking them, and fixing them through debugging and experimentation. My current focus is Unity gameplay development, where I work on mechanics, player movement, physics interactions, and UI systems. Alongside technical growth, I am interested in how technical ideas evolve into real products and businesses.",
